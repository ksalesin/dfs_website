<h1>about</h1>
<p><em>Entangled Ecologies</em> is a student-led digital fashion show and exhibition exploring how bodies, technologies, and environments weave together into living systems of expression. We're interested in the messy, beautiful connections between people, technology, and the more-than-human world. In a moment defined by accelerating computation and ecological collapse, we ask:</p>
<p class="quote">What does it mean to design with, rather than against, the world around us?</p>
<p>We're exploring how clothing and art can move, sense, and respond. How might a dress might breathe with its wearer? How might a circuit mimic a root system? How might machines grow gardens of their own? Borrowing ideas from kinetic sculpture (think Iris van Herpen, Choe U-Ram) and Jessica Riskin's “Machines in the Garden,” our exhibition reconsiders the boundary between mechanism and life. We're curious! How can fashion become a playground for human-computer interaction, a medium to express the entanglement of self, society, and ecology? Our theme of <em>Entangled Ecologies</em> invites <em><strong>everyone</strong></em> (of any background!) to build, upcycle, sew, and/or imagine something that lives between worlds: fashion and engineering, biology and computation, body and environment. We invite YOU! Students from across all disciplines are invited to experiment, fabricate, and speculate. The goal is not perfection, but process, imagination, and revelation. This is a space for play and self-expression. The sky is the limit. Come build something that moves, glows, grows, or simply makes people feel. Runway pieces, projection art, wearables, sculpture, sound... everything belongs here. Join us in crafting new forms of sensing, storytelling, and connection!</p>

<p>Interested in fashion, technology, and the living systems that connect them?
We're seeking artists, designers, and makers to submit to our Spring 2026 exhibition!
Your work could appear in a runway show and exhibition at the Hopkins Center for the Arts (HOP) in June 2026.
Theme: "Entangled Ecologies." Open to interpretation, exploring the entanglement of bodies, environments, and machines. Think: fabric meets code, textiles become electronic, and technology mirrors ecology.</p>
